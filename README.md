# OCaml Debugging and Performance

The premise of this collection of notes is to gather information about
OCaml Debugging and Performance, and provide a single source of information
about OCaml Performance and tooling, native OCaml debugging and related topics.

This work is inherently practical in nature, if you have a working knowledge of
OCaml and systems performance tools then it should be possible to follow along.

The book is available under [book](book).

Ultimately this documentation should go into http://ocamlverse.net , the ocaml manual
or https://ocaml.org/docs .

Writing
---------

I am using [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) for building the book,
so we require a rust installation. Checkout rustup and follow the instructions.

``` shell
> cargo install mdbook mdbook-toc
```

Preview the book locally using `mdbook serve --open`.
