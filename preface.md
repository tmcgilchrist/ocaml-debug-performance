# Preface

The premise of this collection of notes is to gather information about
OCaml Debugging and Performance, and provide a single source of information
about OCaml Performance and tooling, native OCaml debugging and related topics.

This work is inherently practical in nature, if you have a working knowledge of
OCaml and systems performance tools then it should be possible to follow along.
